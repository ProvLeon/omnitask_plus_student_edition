# Omnitask Plus Student Edition Frontend

Welcome to the frontend repository of Omnitask Plus Student Edition, a dynamic and user-friendly task management system tailored for students. This project is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, aiming to provide a seamless and productive user experience.

## Features

- **React**: Leverages React for building a responsive and interactive UI.
- **TypeScript**: Utilizes TypeScript for static type checking, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code quality.
- **Vite**: Employs Vite for a fast development environment with out-of-the-box Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ProvLeon/omnitask_plus_student_edition.git`
2. Navigate to the `omnitask_plus_frontend` directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production applications, consider enhancing the ESLint configuration for type-aware linting rules. This involves configuring the `parserOptions` and updating the `extends` list with more strict rules and stylistic preferences.
