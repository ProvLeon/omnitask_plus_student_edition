# Omnitask Plus Student Edition

Welcome to Omnitask Plus Student Edition, a comprehensive task management system designed to help students manage their academic and personal tasks efficiently. This project is divided into two main components: the frontend and the backend, each tailored to provide a seamless and productive user experience.

## Overview

Omnitask Plus Student Edition combines the power of a dynamic frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, and a robust backend developed using Flask and SQLAlchemy. This combination ensures a responsive, interactive user interface and a secure, scalable server-side application.

### Frontend

The frontend of Omnitask Plus Student Edition is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, leveraging React for building a responsive UI, TypeScript for static type checking, and Vite for a fast development environment. It provides students with an interactive platform to manage their tasks, study sessions, and more.

### Backend

The backend is structured to support the frontend with a wide range of functionalities, including user management, task management, and study session tracking. It uses Flask as the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and Flask-Migrate for database migrations, among other technologies.
